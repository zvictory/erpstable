# NEXTAUTH_URL - IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT NOTE
# ============================================
#
# In DEVELOPMENT: Leave this unset to allow NextAuth to auto-detect the host
# from incoming requests. This enables seamless access via:
#   - http://localhost:3000
#   - http://127.0.0.1:3000
#   - http://192.168.1.110:3000 (or any network IP)
#   - http://any-hostname:3000
#
# In PRODUCTION: Set this to your public domain URL to prevent Host header attacks:
#   NEXTAUTH_URL="https://your-domain.com"
#
# For local development with explicit configuration, you can set:
#   NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
# But this will restrict access to that hostname only.
